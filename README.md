# PersonaForge

PersonaForge is a character development app for writers, game designers, and creators who want to craft psychologically authentic, story-driven characters using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) system, narrative arc templates, and intelligent inter-character simulations.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This app empowers storytellers to create layered, believable characters by integrating deep psychological archetypes (MBTI), simplified but potent story arcs, and dynamic relationship tracking. Whether you're writing a novel, building a game, or creating a webcomic, PersonaForge is your creative co-pilot.

## âœ¨ Concept

PersonaForge merges three powerful storytelling tools into one platform:

1. **MBTI-Based Character Creation** â€“ Select from 16 personality types, each with predefined cognitive stacks, love languages, conflict styles, and dialogue patterns.
2. **Protagonist Arc Blueprint System** â€“ Choose from a library of narrative arcs to guide character development across stories.
3. **Story Folders & Character Management** â€“ Group characters by story, track their development, and organize their details in one place.
4. **Relationship Dynamics Engine** *(coming soon)* â€“ Define emotional bonds, rivalries, and love triangles between characters, with automated narrative implications.
5. **AI Dialogue Simulator** *(coming soon)* â€“ Drop two characters into a scenario and generate authentic interactions based on their MBTI profiles.
